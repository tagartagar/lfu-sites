<p align="justify">Viktor Mikhaylovich Vasnetsov, (born May 3 [May 15, New Style], 1848, Lopyal, Vyatka province, Russia—died July 23, 1926, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.), Russian artist, designer, and architect whose monumental works include the facade of the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. He was the older brother of the painter Apollinary Vasnetsov.Born into the family of a priest, Viktor received his first drawing lessons in the Vyatsky Seminary in the early 1860s. In 1867 he moved to St. Petersburg and enrolled in the Drawing School of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, where he was mentored by Ivan Kramskoy of the Peredvizhniki (“Wanderers”) group, which rejected the classicism of the Russian Academy. Vasnetsov later finished his studies at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts (1868–75). He was awarded the academy’s Grand Silver Medal for his sketch Christ and Pilate Before the People (1870). In 1878 he himself joined the Peredvizhniki.</p>
