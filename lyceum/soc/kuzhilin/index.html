Trading is a core function of CS:GO and many other games on Steam.
Before starting any trading process, you should make sure that your account is eligible for trading. 
You'll need to have Steam Guard enabled for 15 days and have a valid purchase through Steam that's at least a week old but not older than a year.
Fulfilling these two requirements will render your account fit for trading, but changing devices can also cause minor delays.
I would like to show you some skins.
